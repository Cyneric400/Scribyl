So I need to figure out how this thing is going to work...I need to figure out the user interatciont system.

I need to be able to view old notes, fast. Ideally maybe display five notes and their text at a time with a view command?

This won't work for my to-do lists...not sure it was meant to, though. So...this is just for reminders; things to do later that I know I'm never going to get to.

Oooh feature idea--have things that can be marked as resolved, which are then archived so they're not always in my way.

This will eventually have to connect to a database...

## Commands:
- add note
- delete note
- edit note
- view notes
- view all notes
- view a particular note
- help, because I'm probably going to forget my own syntax eventually

## Syntax:
- short, more natural language commands would work...
- if I'm using string splitting, it doesn't have to use flags...there's just an options list.

## Name ideas:
- Scribbr
- Scribbles
- Scribby
- Scribblie

Honestly Scribby is my favorite already... *looks it up* There's a Scribbie and Scribbr that show up, but not Scribby. Nice...not like I'm publishing this, though. It needs to stay simple. Very simple.
